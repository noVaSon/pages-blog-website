# My first blog

This page makes my personal path as a developer accessible as a dairy-like blog on resoruces I worked through. 
My journey started in 2016, so there is a lot left out. Anyways, I want to address three goals here:

- sharing my insights and findings to aid other self-thaught developers in their learning
- logging my steps to monitor and remember the path I took
- showing my progress to colleagues and employers to make them able to judge my skills

This website is closely related to the resources in my other repo called: "erics-dev-dairy"
